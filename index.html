      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, and crescent-shaped pastry of Austrian
      origin, but it's most commonly associated with France. Made from a
      laminated dough, the layers are created by folding butter into the dough
      multiple times, which gives the pastry its characteristic texture.
      Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with a variety of ingredients
      such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese. They are typically
      enjoyed as a breakfast item or a snack.
